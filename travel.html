		   <h3>In July of 2019, my family and I traveled to Europe for 11 days and we visited Germany, Switzerland, Vatican City, Italy, Monaco and France. It was exciting to see many famous monuments and I enjoyed the beautiful scenery.</h3>

		   <h3>When my family arrived at the airport, it was buzzing as people were checking in and going through security. The feeling of an airport made me exhilarated for our adventure. We waited a couple of hours as we ate some food before going on the plane. The plane ride was around 9 hours and for most of the time, I watched movies and listened to music.</h3>
